\title{Extract party logo URL from Wikipedia}
\usage{
get_party_logo(url, use_cache = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{url}{A character vector of Wikipedia URLs for political party pages.}

\item{use_cache}{Logical. If `TRUE` (default), looks up data in the bundled
`party_data` dataset first before scraping Wikipedia. If `FALSE`, always
scrapes live from Wikipedia. Using the cache is much faster and reduces
load on Wikipedia servers.}
}
\value{
A character vector of logo image URLs (or NA for failed extractions
  or pages without logos).
}
\description{
Extracts the party logo image URL from a political party's English Wikipedia
page. The function scrapes the party infobox for the logo image.
}
\details{
By default, this function uses the bundled `party_data` dataset which contains
pre-scraped logo URLs for major political parties. This provides instant lookups
without network requests. If a party is not in the bundled data, the function
automatically falls back to live Wikipedia scraping. Set `use_cache = FALSE`
to always scrape fresh data from Wikipedia.

The function looks for logo images in the Wikipedia infobox. The returned
URL is typically a Wikimedia Commons thumbnail URL. Note that some party
pages may not have logos, or the logo may be in a non-standard location.

The returned URLs point to image files hosted on Wikimedia servers. These
can be used directly in R graphics or downloaded for further processing.

For use with `dplyr::mutate()`, this function is vectorized over the `url`
argument.
