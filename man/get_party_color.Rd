\title{Extract party color from Wikipedia}
\usage{
get_party_color(url, all_colors = FALSE, normalize = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{url}{A character vector of Wikipedia URLs for political party pages.}

\item{all_colors}{Logical. If `FALSE` (default), returns only the first/primary
color. If `TRUE`, returns all colors as a list.}

\item{normalize}{Logical. If `TRUE` (default), attempts to normalize color
values to uppercase hex codes. Named colors (e.g., "red") are converted
to hex codes.}
}
\value{
If `all_colors = FALSE`, a character vector of hex color codes
  (or NA for failed extractions). If `all_colors = TRUE`, a list of
  character vectors containing all colors for each URL.
}
\description{
Extracts the primary party color (or all colors) from a political party's
English Wikipedia page. The function scrapes the party infobox for color
information.
}
\details{
The function works by scraping the Wikipedia infobox (vcard table) for
spans with background-color style attributes. This depends on Wikipedia's
current HTML structure and may occasionally fail if the page structure changes.

For use with `dplyr::mutate()`, this function is vectorized over the `url`
argument. Each URL is processed independently.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Single party
get_party_color("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)")

# Multiple parties
urls <- c(
  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)",
  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"
)
get_party_color(urls)

# Get all colors (some parties have multiple)
get_party_color(urls, all_colors = TRUE)

# Use with dplyr
library(dplyr)
parties <- tibble(
  party = c("Democrats", "Republicans"),
  wiki_url = urls
)
parties \%>\%
  mutate(color = get_party_color(wiki_url))
