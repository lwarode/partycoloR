party_data
}
\description{
A dataset containing pre-scraped party colors and logos from Wikipedia for
political parties in the Party Facts database. This dataset is bundled with
the package to provide fast lookups without requiring live Wikipedia scraping.
}
\details{
This dataset contains pre-scraped color and logo information for political
parties from the Party Facts Wikipedia dataset, covering parties worldwide
that have English Wikipedia pages with available color data.

The data is used by default in [get_party_color()], [get_party_logo()],
and [get_party_info()] to provide instant lookups. If a party is not
found in this dataset, the functions automatically fall back to live
Wikipedia scraping.

Color codes are normalized to uppercase 6-digit HEX format (e.g., "#FF0000").
Logo URLs point to images hosted on Wikimedia Commons.

To regenerate or update this dataset, see the script at
`data-raw/update.R` in the package source.
