\title{Extract party information from Wikipedia}
\usage{
get_party_info(url, all_colors = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{url}{A character vector of Wikipedia URLs for political party pages.}

\item{all_colors}{Logical. If `FALSE` (default), returns only the primary
color in the `color` column. If `TRUE`, adds an `all_colors` list-column.}
}
\value{
A tibble with columns: `url`, `color` (primary color as hex),
  `logo_url`, and optionally `all_colors` (list of all colors).
}
\description{
Extracts both the party color(s) and logo URL from a political party's
English Wikipedia page in a single call.
}
\details{
This function combines [get_party_color()] and [get_party_logo()] into
a single call, which is more efficient when you need both pieces of
information as it only fetches each Wikipedia page once.
