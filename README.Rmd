# partycoloR

[![CRAN_Status_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/partycoloR?color=brightgreen)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=partycoloR)

The goal of partycoloR is to extract color information from Wikipedia articles of political parties. Party colors are playing a crucial role in visually identifying political parties.
The function `wikipedia_party_color` extracts the party color code (HEX/HTML color codes / names) from webscraped English Wikipedia political party pages. 
The input argument needs to be a list and the function generates a data frame / tibble with all the extracted color codes / names.

## Installation

You can install the released version of partycoloR from [GitHub](https://github.com/lwarode/partycoloR) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("lwarode/partycoloR")
```

## Example

The input argument is a list of political party articles (URL) from English Wikipedia. 
The function returns a data frame / tibble with all party colors (as HEX color or HTML color code).

```r
party_list <- list("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)",
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)")

party_color_df <- wikipedia_party_color(party_list)

glimpse(party_color_df)
```
